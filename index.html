    <u><strong>The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web</strong></u>,
    a subset of the Internet
    consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people
    assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms
    interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global
    network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the
    Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the
    Internet, but they are not one and same.
